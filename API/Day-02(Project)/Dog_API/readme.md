
# 🐶 Random Dog Image Generator 🎉

Welcome to the **Random Doggo Fetcher** 🐾 — a cute and simple web app that fetches and displays random dog images from a public API every time you click a button! 🦴

---

## ✨ Features

🐕 Fetches **a new dog image** with each click  
📷 Loads one random image automatically on page load  
🎯 Uses **Dog CEO's Dog API** for real-time image fetching  
🧠 Built with **Vanilla JavaScript** — no frameworks needed!

## 🔍 How It Works

1. The `DogApi()` function makes a `fetch()` call to:

```

[https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random](https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random)

```

2. The response contains a `message` key with the image URL 🖼️  
3. The image `src` is updated with the new dog image  
4. A click on the button triggers a new fetch instantly! 🖱️
